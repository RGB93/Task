    <ul>
        <li><b>SPORTMANSHIP</b></li>
        <ol> The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
            team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
            this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
        </ol>
        <li><b>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</b>
            <ol>
                <li><b>DIMENSIONS.</b>
                    <ol> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
                        a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                        adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> </li>
                <ol> The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                    this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                    background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
                </ol>
                <li><b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</b></li>
                   <ol type="a" start="c">
                        <li> U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields 
                            for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                        <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                        <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                        <li> In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal 
                            dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>ALL-PLAY</b></li>
        <ol> All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast 
            fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged 
            to play their players 50% of each game. 
            <ol class="outline">
                <li> A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game 
                    under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice 
                    and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and 
                    injuries.</li>
